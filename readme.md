Cricket World Cup 2022 – Data-Driven Dream XI
🎯 Objectives

Collect and process cricket data for structured analysis.

Use Python (NumPy, Pandas) for data cleaning and JSON → CSV conversion.

Apply transformations and modeling in Power BI.

Build interactive dashboards to visualize player performances.

Define and implement a selection framework for a balanced World Playing XI.

🔧 Methodology
1. Data Collection & Preparation

Sourced data directly from ESPNcricinfo.

Collected multiple years of match and player performance data.

Extracted raw data in JSON format.

Used Python (NumPy & Pandas) to:

Parse JSON

Convert into structured CSV files

Perform basic preprocessing (removing nulls, formatting columns)

2. Data Transformation (Power BI)

Imported processed CSVs into Power BI Query Editor.

Cleaned datasets further: handled missing values, standardized metrics.

Computed derived indicators such as:

Batting average

Strike rate

Economy rate

Consistency index

Organized data models for dashboard integration.

3. Dashboard Development

Created role-specific dashboards in Power BI:

🎯 Top Bowlers – wickets, economy rate, and consistency

⚡ All-Rounders – combined batting and bowling impact

🔄 Spinners – control in middle overs and wicket-taking ability

🔥 Openers – strike rate, boundary percentage, consistency in starts

🏏 Middle-Order Batters – anchors and finishers

4. World Playing XI Selection

Designed a final dashboard to consolidate all insights.

Applied selection criteria focusing on:

Individual performance

Team balance (batting, bowling, all-round skills)

Match impact and consistency over years

Selected a data-driven Playing XI from the Super 12 teams.

🏆 Selection Criteria

Batting → Runs scored, strike rate, role-specific contributions.

Bowling → Economy rate, wickets taken, impact in key matches.

All-Round Performance → Dual-role effectiveness.

Team Composition → Proper mix of openers, middle-order batters, all-rounders, spinners, and fast bowlers.

Consistency Across Years → Considered past trends, not just 2022.
